# Tech Conferences With Childcare

## How it works

In the [CodeNewbie](http://www.codenewbie.org) Twitter chat tonight (4/5/2017), several people mentioned lack of childcare as a barrier for their attendance at tech conferences. I thought a list like this should exist, so I'm making one real quick before I head to bed (can't snooze the kid-alarm!).

I'm sure I'll fine-tune this readme tomorrow, but in the meanwhile:

- Make a PR to add a conference to the list!
